"""
Training pipeline skeleton.

This script orchestrates model training using the OLMo codebase. Nothing here
is functional yet – the code below merely documents the high-level structure we
intend to flesh out.

Outline
-------
1. Parse command-line arguments / load Hydra configuration.
2. Prepare datasets (OpenWebText for pre-training, ARC & GSM8K for evaluation).
3. Instantiate GPT-2-style transformer via OLMo utilities.
4. Run training loop with periodic checkpointing.
5. At each checkpoint, extract sparse features & build co-activation graphs.
6. Evaluate on benchmark tasks to detect emergent capabilities.
7. Save artefacts (metrics, graphs, checkpoints) for downstream analysis.
