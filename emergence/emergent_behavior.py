"""
Skeleton definitions related to emergent behaviour.

Notes
-----
We currently do not have a formal definition for emergent behaviour. This
module therefore only sketches the rough structure of the code we expect to
live here â€“ no functional implementation is provided yet.

TODO
----
1. Agree on a working definition for emergent behaviour in the context of our
   experiments.
2. Specify data structures that will capture emergent events.
3. Implement detection logic driven by sparse-feature co-activation graphs.
4. Integrate with the training loop so that detection runs at each checkpoint.
