"""
Emergence module.

This package will contain utilities for detecting, tracking, and analyzing
emergent behaviour within transformer models trained with the OLMo codebase.

For now, this is just a placeholder that declares the package so that it can be
imported by the rest of the project. Concrete implementations will be added as
our definition of emergent behaviour solidifies.
